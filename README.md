In database, there are 5 tables that I used: products, products_groups, orders, orders_2020, customers. In other files there is information about columns and their types (check that to understand relations between specific tables).
The main goal of this exercise was to learn basic and more advanced SQL and present skills that I have achieved.
Main file is called "supersales queries". You can find there some queries that I wrote to first clean data and then analyze to find some information about the data we have in that database. I have used some popular SQL formulas to provide
some interesting facts.
